    - Acne or oily skin
    - Weight gain or difficulty losing weight

    **Possible treatments and medications:**
    - **Lifestyle changes:** Healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management can help regulate cycles.
    - **Medications:**
        - *Birth control pills* to regulate periods and reduce androgen levels.
        - *Metformin* to improve insulin resistance and help with weight loss.
        - *Clomiphene* or *Letrozole* to stimulate ovulation if trying to conceive.
        - *Anti-androgens* (like spironolactone) to reduce excess hair and acne.
